# Drug-Discovery-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop novel drug candidates targeting the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR), a key player in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Utilizing machine learning techniques, we analyze bioactivity data to identify potent inhibitors of EGFR, ultimately accelerating the drug discovery process.
